        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Chloe Chen. I am from Brooklyn, New York. I graduated from 
            Brooklyn Technical High School. I am in the RIT Accelerated Scholars BS/MS program
            for Software Engineering, and I am also a part of the Honors Program. I am involved 
            with WiC and the GameDev club. Some of my hobbies are reading, playing video games, 
            listening to music, and watching dramas. I am especially a huge fan of K-dramas and 
            C-dramas. I also enjoy playing instruments in my free time.
